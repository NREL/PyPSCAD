# PyPSCAD

Various IEEE Test Networks have been developed to run with the constucted, generic, averaged, full order grid following and grid forming inverter models.

The device models are described in the following publication:
 'Open-Source PSCAD Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Inverters and A Benchmark for Zero-Inertia Power System Simulations', 2021 Kansas Power and Energy Conference, Under-review
 
The 39 bus system, which has been split to operate on 7 cores, was used for the following publication:
 'Frequency Dynamics with Grid Forming Inverters: A New Stability Paradigm', submitted to IEEE transactions on power systems.
